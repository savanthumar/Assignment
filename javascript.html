    <p>JavaScript is a client-side programming language used to create dynamic interactions in app, game and web development. Commonly represented as JS, this language is considered one of the core technologies of the web in conjunction with HTML and CSS. 


Developers use JavaScript to bring a webpage to life, as it transforms an otherwise static page into one that responds to user engagement, livens up the page with motion, and displays real-time, variable, and personalized content.
